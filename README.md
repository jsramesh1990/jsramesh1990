I've reimagined your introductory profile with the creativity and technical depth that reflects a senior engineer's mindset, incorporating elements of market trends and a forward-thinking approach.

**👋 Hi there, I'm Sebastian Ramesh**
*   👂 My name is **Sebastian Ramesh, but my commits are more recognizable**.
*   👩 Pronouns: **He / Him / The Debugger**
*   🔭 I’m currently working on **architecting a secure, over-the-air update pipeline for a fleet of Edge AI sensors, because reliable deployment is as critical as the algorithm**.
*   🌱 I’m currently learning **Zephyr RTOS in depth and exploring RISC-V toolchains to future-proof my hardware abstraction layer thinking**.
*   🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source hardware/software co-design projects, or with startups building the next generation of intelligent, secure IoT devices**.
*   🤔 I’m looking for help with **finding exceptional freelance projects that challenge the balance between ultra-low-power design and real-time processing demands**.
*   💬 Ask me about **the journey from a bare-metal register toggle to a stable Linux BSP, or how to debug a timing issue that only happens at -40°C**.
*   📫 How to reach me: **`js.ramesh1990@gmail.com` | [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/sebastian-ramesh-b84911327) — Let's talk embedded systems or innovative product ideas**.
*   ❤️ I love **the moment a board powers on for the first time, elegant solutions to memory constraints, and well-documented vendor errata**.
*   ⚡ Fun fact: **I've written drivers for touchscreens, but I still get a visceral satisfaction from a physical, clicky mechanical keyboard**.

This version is crafted to showcase your expertise in a memorable, personable, and technically robust way, tailored for platforms like GitHub or LinkedIn. I can also generate the equivalent profile in a ready-to-use markdown table format if that would be helpful for you.
